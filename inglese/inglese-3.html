            ## Second Generation of Romantic Poets
            - Lord Byron, Shally, and Keats were disillusioned by the clash
            between their ideals and the reality of the French Revolution.
            - They felt alienated from society and embraced individualism.
            - Lord Byron embodied the rebellious and adventurous "Byronic hero."
            - Shally expressed hope for a better society in his poems.
            - Keats found solace in the world of classics and the beauty of art.
            ## Keats
            - Keats found consolation in the eternal and immutable nature of
            art.
            - In his poem "Ode on a Grecian Urn," he describes the scenes
            depicted on ancient Greek vases and the idea that what is fixed in
            art remains forever.
            - He also explores the concept that imagination can often be better
            than reality.
            - Keats' pessimistic view of life was influenced by personal losses
            and his own health struggles.
            ## La Belle Dame Sans Merci
            - It is a ballad about a knight and a beautiful woman.
            - The knight meets the woman in a meadow and falls in love with her.
            - They spend time together, but the woman eventually reveals her
            true nature and the knight becomes a victim.
            - The ballad ends in a cyclic form, with no hope for progression or
            resolution.
            ## Romantic Novels
            - There are three types: gothic novels, historical novels, and
            novels of manners.
            - Walter Scott is the father of historical novels, focusing on
            Scottish and English history.
            - Jane Austen represents the novel of manners, depicting the social
            customs and events of the countryside.
            - Austen's novels emphasize the importance of love and marriage,
            while also highlighting the need for balance between emotions and
            common sense.
            ## Victorian Age
            - The Victorian Age was characterized by the reign of Queen Victoria
            and the second industrial revolution.
            - It was a period of great wealth and progress, but also social
            problems and contradictions.
            - The era was marked by hypocrisy, social reforms, and a focus on
            respectability.
            - Utilitarianism, the philosophy of Jeremy Bentham, emphasized
            material happiness over moral aspects.
            ## Charles Dickens
            - Dickens was a representative writer of the Victorian Age, focusing
            on social issues and the lives of the working class.
            - His novels, such as "Oliver Twist" and "Hard Times," exposed the
            problems of industrialization and poverty.
            - Dickens used humor and caricature-like characters to convey his
            message.
            ## Ulysses by Lord Tennyson
            - Tennyson's poem explores the contrast between the adventurous
            spirit of Ulysses and the sedentary life of his son Telemachus.
            - Ulysses longs for new adventures and refuses to accept a
            monotonous life in Ithaca.
            - The poem embodies a romantic idea of life and contrasts it with
            the Victorian ideals of respectability and conformity.

            Stevenson

            hidden evil side, Mr Hyde.
