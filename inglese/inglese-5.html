            # George Orwell
            - George Orwell was born in India to an English family and later
            sent to Britain for education.
            - He studied at Eton, a prestigious and exclusive public school.
            - Orwell worked as a journalist and conducted social experiments,
            living among the homeless in London and Paris.
            - He was politically and socially committed, writing novels like
            "1984" and "Animal Farm" to represent oppression and tyranny.
            ## 1984
            - "1984" is a dystopian novel set in Oceania, ruled by the Party and
            its leader, Big Brother.
            - The protagonist, Winston Smith, works for the Ministry of Truth,
            where news and information are manipulated.
            - The Party controls thoughts and actions, using telescreens,
            posters, and the thought police.
            - The Party introduces Newspeak, a simplified language to limit
            thoughts and control the population.
            - Winston rebels against the Party but is eventually captured,
            tortured, and brainwashed.
            ## Animal Farm
            - "Animal Farm" is an allegorical novel about a farm where animals
            revolt against their human owner, Mr. Jones.
            - The animals establish a democratic system based on the principles
            of animalism.
            - The pigs, led by Napoleon, gradually take control and become
            dictators.
            - Napoleon uses propaganda, violence, and manipulation to maintain
            power.
            - The revolution fails, and the animals continue to be exploited
            while the pigs live luxuriously.
            ## Connections
            - Both "1984" and "Animal Farm" explore themes of oppression,
            manipulation, and the failure of revolutions.
            - Orwell uses allegory and symbolism to criticize totalitarian
            regimes and the dangers of unchecked power.
            - The novels highlight the importance of individual freedom,
            critical thinking, and resistance against oppressive systems.
